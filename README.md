# Welcome to Gitcoin


Welcome to the community of designers here to help build and fund the open web. We're pushing open source to improve the user experience and interface design of web3.


## Our Design Ethos

We believe in designing together.

**Open**
We want to be shaped by the community and welcome all contributors to collaborate and participate in building Gitcoin. 

**Decentralized**
We welcome your ideas, we're open for your proposals to grow the project.

**Forward**
We are daring, take risks and learn from our experiments.

**Punk**
Because of the nature the community that influences our designs, there is edginess/rawness in our work.
