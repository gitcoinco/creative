# Kudos

Kudos is a way of showing your appreciation for another Gitcoin member.

It's also a way to showcase special skills that a member might have, such as Pythonista, or Design Star. Kudos tokens can be bought and sold on the Kudos Marketplace.

## How do I create a new Kudos?

#### Not an artist?

1. Open up a Github Issue [here](https://github.com/gitcoinco/kudosbadges/issues/new).
2. Gitcoin will connect you with an artist who can work on your Kudos.

#### Are you an artist?

Here's how to work on Kudos:

1. Kudos must be ORIGINAL art or art you own the liscense to. If you are creating a Gitcoin-funded kudos, [email us](mailto:founders@gitcoin.co) to negotiate a rate for your artwork. Please include your portfolio link. If you are going the Self Sovereign route, skip this step and proceed to next step.
2. Checkout the latest [kudos design guide](https://github.com/gitcoinco/creative/blob/master/Product/kudos_guide/kudosguide_latest.pdf). You can download the base kudos template here: [illustrator template](https://github.com/gitcoinco/kudosbadges/raw/master/kudos_template.ai) or the [svg template](https://github.com/gitcoinco/kudosbadges/blob/master/kudos_template.svg)
